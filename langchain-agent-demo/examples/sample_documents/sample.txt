LangChain Framework Overview
============================

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications
powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a standardized interface for working
with various LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and others.

Key Features:

1. Chains: LangChain allows you to create sequences of operations (chains) that process
   data through multiple steps. This makes it easy to build complex workflows.

2. Agents: Agents use LLMs to decide which actions to take. They can use external tools
   and APIs to accomplish tasks.

3. Memory: LangChain provides various memory implementations to maintain context across
   interactions in conversational applications.

4. Prompts: The framework includes utilities for managing and optimizing prompts, making
   it easier to get the best results from LLMs.

5. Document Loaders: LangChain supports loading data from various sources including PDFs,
   websites, databases, and more.

6. Vector Stores: Integration with vector databases like FAISS, Pinecone, and Chroma
   enables semantic search and retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

LangGraph Extension:

LangGraph extends LangChain with stateful, multi-actor applications. It allows developers
to define workflows as graphs with nodes and edges, making it easier to build and
visualize complex AI systems. LangGraph is particularly useful for:

- Multi-agent systems
- Complex decision trees
- Cyclic workflows
- Conditional routing

Use Cases:

- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Question-answering systems
- Document analysis and summarization
- Code generation and analysis
- Research and information synthesis
- Automated customer support

Getting Started:

To start using LangChain, install it via pip:
pip install langchain langchain-openai

Then configure your API keys and start building!
